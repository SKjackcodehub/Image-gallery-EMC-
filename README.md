Overview
The image gallery displays a collection of images fetched from an online source (picsum.photos) with a responsive layout, allowing the images to wrap and adjust based on the screen size.

Usage
Clone the repository or download the files: Ensure you have both the index.html and style.css files.
Open the index.html file: You can open it in any web browser to view the gallery.

##HTML 
HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the web. It defines the structure of web pages using elements represented by tags. These tags can include text, links, images, and other multimedia.

Key Features:
Structure: HTML provides the basic structure of a website, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
Elements and Tags: HTML consists of a series of elements and tags that help define different parts of a webpage (e.g., <div>, <p>, <a>, <img>, <h1>).
Attributes: Tags can have attributes that provide additional information about elements (e.g., src for images, href for links).

##CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS controls the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

Key Features:
Styling: CSS is used to define the look and formatting of HTML elements (e.g., colors, fonts, spacing, layout).
Selectors: CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements you want to style.
Properties and Values: CSS uses properties and values to apply styles (e.g., color, font-size, margin).
